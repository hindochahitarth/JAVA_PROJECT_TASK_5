# Java Developer Internship â€“ Task 5: Bank Account Simulation

## Objective
Simulate basic bank operations using Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The program allows account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and displays account details, mimicking real-world banking scenarios.

## Tools
- Java  
- VS Code  
- Terminal  

## Deliverables
A class-based Java program implementing basic bank transactions using OOP principles.

## Key Concepts
- Classes & Objects  
- Encapsulation  
- Method Overloading & Overriding  
- Constructors  
- Object Instantiation  

## Hints / Mini Guide
1. Implement an `Account` class with attributes like account number, account holder name, balance, IFSC code, and location.  
2. Include methods for depositing money (`depmoney`) and withdrawing money (`withmoney`).  
3. Maintain account balance and display transaction updates.  
4. Use constructors for object initialization.  
5. Implement `toString()` to display account details neatly.  

## Outcome
- Ability to simulate real-world banking operations.  
- Understanding of OOP concepts like encapsulation, constructors, and methods in Java.
